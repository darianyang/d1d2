    * copied from 2kod/o_angle/1d_oamax_v04
    * replaced with bstate from end of 1a43 stdMD v00

3d_oamax_1_2_ss_v00:
    * copied from 2kod/o_angle/3d_oamax_1_2_ss_v00
    * replaced with bstate from end of 1a43 stdMD v00
    * after 500i, ran 500 more with tstate from one oa as >50 to both >50
        * actually, from succ.txt, not sure if the updated tstate took effect
        * could be that the simulation needs to be reinitialized

3d_oamax_1_2_ss_v01:
    * running again using an updated tstate:
        * from long timescale 3d oamax 2kod ssWE sim: trying > 45 degrees for both oa
