stdMD:
    * std simulations of the 150-231 CTD construct that should have 50/50 D1/D2

2d_we_v00:
    * started with 2d_1b_v01 2kod template
    * needed to move all pcoord and aux data to shift -6 and -12 residues for m1 and m2

1d_oapdt_v00:
    * started with 150-end 2d_we_v00 as template
    * changing to pdt of oangles as pcoord
        * thus added oangle 1 and 2 to aux data
    * 25 mab bins in 1d
