/ihome/lchong/dty7/Apps/anaconda3/envs/hamsm/lib/python3.10/site-packages/nbformat/__init__.py:129: MissingIDFieldWarning: Code cell is missing an id field, this will become a hard error in future nbformat versions. You may want to use `normalize()` on your notebooks before validations (available since nbformat 5.1.4). Previous versions of nbformat are fixing this issue transparently, and will stop doing so in the future.
